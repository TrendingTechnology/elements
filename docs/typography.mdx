# Typography

A majority of the way users interact with UI is with writing. Because of this we've developed a type system that ties our products together and is both approachable and understandable.

<Playground column>
  <h1>Hero - 60px / 1.2 / 200</h1>
  <h2>Headline - 48px / 1.25 / 400</h2>
  <h3>Title - 36px / 1.334 / 400</h3>
  <h4>Subtitle - 24px / 1.5 / 400</h4>
  <h5>Body (Emphasis) - 18px / 1.334 / 800</h5>
  <p>Body - 18px / 1.334 / 400</p>
</Playground>

## Usage

The easiest way to use this type stack is by importing the `Base` component at the root of your application.

### Class Names

Along with styling the raw text elements, one can style any elements text correctly by using one of the following classes

`type--hero`, `type--headline`, `type--title`, `type--subtitle`, `emphasis`.
