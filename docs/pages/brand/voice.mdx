# Voice and tone

What’s the difference between voice and tone? We always have the same voice, but our tone should change depending on setting and situation. For example, our tone may be slightly playful in an email and more informative in a support email. But we always use the same overall voice.

## Voice

- Conversational
- Relational
- Calm
- Friendly
- Thoughtful
- Modern
- Balanced
- Approachable
- Open
