# Progress Bar

<Status status="production" />

## Installation

```
import {
  FixedProgress,
  FluidProgress
} from "@rent_avail/elements/progress-bar"
```

## Description

A progress bar indicates the status of a user inside a process. It help a user understand what they've accomplished and what is yet to come. This gives them a realistic idea of time to completion and lowers uncertainty.

## Fixed Progress Anatomy

1. Step - `.step`
2. Step Label - `.label`

A fixed progress bar has a certain amount of steps and those steps are done in a set order. A fixed bar is used for smaller amounts of steps where the process won't be completed in one sitting.

### Props

<Prop name="steps" type="object" required>
  An object with where the key is the step label and the value is whether the step is
  complete.
</Prop>

## Fluid Progress Anatomy

3. Progress Bar -`.progress`
4. Current label - `.label`
5. Track - `.track`
6. Current / Total - `.steps`

A fluid progress bar can have an almost unlimited amount of steps. It is usually used when the process contains a lot of smaller pieces and can be accomplished in one sitting.

### Props

<Prop name="label" type="string">
  The label currently displayed on the progressBar, should be updated on each render.
</Prop>

<Prop name="current" type="number" required>
  The index of the current step.
</Prop>

<Prop name="total" type="number" required>
  The length of the total steps.
</Prop>

## Usage

<Playground column>
  <FixedProgress
    steps={{
      "Report Submitted": true,
      "Rent Verified": false,
      "Tradeline Created": false
    }}
  />
</Playground>

<Playground column>
  <FluidProgress label="Contact info" current={2} total={6} />
</Playground>

## Extension

The fixed progress bar renders an array of steps with the class `.step` if these steps are `true` they get a class of `.complete`. If you're wanting to change the color of a completed or "next step" you'll want to key off this class name inside of the FixedProgress.

```js
const CustomFixed = styled(FixedProgress)`
  .step.complete {
    background: red;
  }
`

const CustomeFluid = styled(FluidProgress)`
  .track,
  .steps,
  .progress,
  .label {
    background: black; // will make the whole thing black;
  }
`
```
