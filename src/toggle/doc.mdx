# Toggles

Toggles are selection controls that change data immediately. They need to be understood as a boolean (on/off). Toggles are the preferred way to update settings on mobile.

<Playground>
  <Toggle />
</Playground>

Any children of the toggle will be rendered as it's label.

<Playground>
  <Toggle>I'm a label</Toggle>
</Playground>

A common UI pattern is to have a list of toggles with their labels on the lefthand side. This is easily achievable by passing in a `block` prop to the toggle.

<Playground column>
  <h3>Email settings</h3>
  <Toggle block>Payments Emails</Toggle>
  <Toggle block>Applications Emails</Toggle>
  <Toggle block>Maintenance Emails</Toggle>
  <Toggle block>Listings Emails</Toggle>
</Playground>
