# Buttons

<Status status="production" />

## Installation

```js
import Button from "@rent_avail/elements/button"
```

## Description

Buttons allow users to take action or make choices with a quick click. They're placed
throughout the UI in places like `cards`, `modals`, `forms`, and `toolbars`.

## Anatomy

Buttons at Avail (like in Material Design) have uppercase text labels. Buttons come with
two variants baked in and are extendable in whatever way you wish. The default button
should be used the most. It is seen as clickable without being too distracting from the
rest of the UI. If you have a set of buttons together use the `primary` button to
distinguish the most desirable action.

  <Button danger>dont click me</Button>
</Playground>

#### Buttons can also be passed `color` and `textColor` props to customize them.

<Playground>
  <Button primary color={colors.gold_500} textColor={colors.gold_900}>
    oh you fancy huh
  </Button>
</Playground>

## Extension

If you need the look and feel of a button need it to be a link you can do so by using the
`as` prop. You can inspect the element below and see that it's rendering an anchor tag.

This will work with most any element, including react components, as long as it passes on
its `className` prop.

<Playground>
  <Button as="a" href="https://avail.co">
    I'm really a link
  </Button>
</Playground>
