# Building Blocks

This DesignKit is build with an atomic methodology. Each component was designed specifically to fix a UI problem.

## Installation

Installing with your favorite (as long as that favorite is npm) package manager is as easy as

```shell
npm install @rentalutions/elements
```

Each element lives in it's own folder. We're not bundling the library into a single file so that you can `import` each component as you need. This leads to space saving.

```js
import Button from "@rentalutions/elements/button"
import Grid from "@rentalutions/elements/grid"
```

The design kit is built with `styled-components`. This means that each component can be changed easily and undestructively.

```js
import styled from "styled-components"
import Button from "@rentalutions/elements/button"

const MySpecialButton = styled(Button)`
  border-color: red;
  color: red;
`
```
