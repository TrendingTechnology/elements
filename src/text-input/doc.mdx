# Text Inputs

Text inputs let users enter and edit text information. They are made up of a label, value, helper text, and optionally a leading / trailing icon.

<Playground>
  <Input label="Payment Amount" icon={Anchor} />
  <Input label="A really long label to make things extra clear for the user." />
</Playground>

By default inputs are uncontrolled. You gotta wire them up in whatever way you wish. All event handlers happen on the `input` node as expected and refs are forwarded accurately.

_How do I control my inputs?!_ you might ask... Well let me show you! If you haven't read up on [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) now would be a great time to do that as that's what we're going to use here.

<Playground column>
  {() => {
    // Hook to have explicitly set values
    const [userName, setUserName] = useState("Janet Wood")
    // Handler to update state when user changes the value
    const handleChange = e => setUserName(e.target.value)
    return (
      <div>
        <h4 style={{ marginBottom: "2rem" }}>{userName}</h4>
        <Input label="User Name" value={userName} onChange={handleChange} />
      </div>
    )

}}

</Playground>
