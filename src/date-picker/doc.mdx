# Date Inputs

<Status status="beta" />

## Installation

```
import {
  DatePicker,
  DateSearch,
  Calendar
} from "@rent_avail/elements/date-picker"
```

## Description

Date pickers are used to consistently select the correct date. There are two types of date selection tools for use situationally. A `DateSearch` is used when the user will likely not know the exact date they are going to want _and_ the date itself is not more than a couple days or weeks away in either direction. A `DatePicker` is used for a known or exact date and can be months or years from the current date such as a birthday or a lease start date.

## Usage

### Base Calendar

This component is at the heart of the `DateSearch` and can techincally be used on it's own in situations necessary.

<Playground>
  <Calendar onSelect={iso => console.log(iso)} />
</Playground>

### DateSearch

The date search is used for unknown dates close to the current day. It opens a `Calendar` component inline that can automatically fill the input with a correct date.

<Playground>
  <DateSearch
    label="Due Date"
    // Will fire when a date is selected from the calendar.
    onSelect={iso => console.log(iso)}
    // Will fire on change, do whatever you want with the input.
    onChange={e => console.log(e.target.value)}
  />
</Playground>
