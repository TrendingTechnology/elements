# Date Inputs

Date pickers are used to consistently select the correct date. There are two types of date selection tools. A `DatePicker` and a `DateSearch`. The `DatePicker` should be used when the user is likely to know the exact date they'll choose, such as a birthday or anniversary.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [birthday, set] = useState("")
    return (
      <DatePicker
        label={`Your Birthday is: ${birthday}`}
        onBlur={(event, date) => set(date)}
      />
    )
  }}
</Playground>

If the user is unlikely to know the exact date or might be weighing multiple dates to choose the correct one a `DateSearch` should be used. This let's the user see a calendar view of dates and lets them select the optimal one.
