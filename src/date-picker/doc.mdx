# Date Inputs

## Description

Date pickers are used to consistently select the correct date. There are two types of date selection tools for use situationally. A `DateSearch` is used when the user will likely not know the exact date they are going to want _and_ the date itself is not more than a couple days or weeks away in either direction. A `DatePicker` is used for a known or exact date and can be months or years from the current date such as a birthday or a lease start date.

  <Calendar />

### DateSearch

The date search is used for unknown dates close to the current day. It opens a `Calendar` component inline that can automatically fill the input with a correct date.

<Playground>
  <DateSearch label="Due Date" />
