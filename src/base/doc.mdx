# Base

<Status status="production" />

## Installation

```js
import Base from "@rent_avail/elements/base"
```

## Description

This includes base stylings that help make UI across Avail products consistent. You can think of this as our css-reset.

Place the `Base` component at the root of your application. It creates a global reset stylesheet that brings the base font size to 18px as well as setting the root em to 12px.This component uses the `createGlobalStyle` method from `styled-components` to set these base styles in the head of the html document at runtime. The styles include a spacing reset as well as the base typography stack.

## Usage

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <App>
    <Base />
    <Page>{/* The rest of your application */}</Page>
  </App>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
