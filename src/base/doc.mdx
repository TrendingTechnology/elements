# Base

<Status status="production" />

## Installation

```javascript
import Base from "@rent_avail/elements/base"
```

## Description

This includes base stylings that help make UI across Avail products consistent. You can think of this as our css-reset.

Place the `Base` component at the root of your application. It creates a global reset stylesheet that brings the base font size to 18px as well as setting the root em to 12px.

```js
// React + ReactDOM imports
import Base from "@rent_avail/elements/base"

ReactDOM.render(
  <App>
    <Base />
    {/* The rest of your application */}
    <Page />
  </App>,
  document.getElementById("root")
)
```
