# Cards

Cards contain information and actions about a single subject. Cards should be scannable for relevant information. Elements like text and images should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## Usage

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <header>Card Header</header>
    <section>Card Body</section>
    <CardActions>
      <Button>Primary Action</Button>
      <Button>Secondary Action</Button>
    </CardActions>
  </Card>
</Playground>
