# Cards

Cards contain information and actions about a single subject. Cards should be scannable for relevant information. Elements like text and images should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <header>
      <h3>Autopay Settings</h3>
    </header>
    <section
      style={{
        marginBottom: "2rem"
      }}
    >
      <p>Turn on and off your auto-pay settings here.</p>
    </section>
    <CardActions>
      <Button primary>Primary Action</Button>
      <Button>Secondary Action</Button>
    </CardActions>
  </Card>
</Playground>
