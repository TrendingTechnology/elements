# Building Blocks

The design kit is built with `styled-components`. This means that each component can be changed easily and undestructively. Each component was designed specifically to fix a UI problem.

## Installation

Installing with your favorite (as long as that favorite is npm) package manager is as easy as

```bash
npm install @rentalutions/elements
```

Each element lives in it's own folder. We're not bundling the library into a single file so that you can `import` each component as you need. This leads to space saving.

```
import Button from "@rentalutions/elements/button"
import Grid from "@rentalutions/elements/grid"
```
