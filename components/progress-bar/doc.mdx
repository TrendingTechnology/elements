# Progress Bar

A progress bar indicates the status of a user inside a process. It help a user understand what they've accomplished and what is yet to come. This gives them a realistic idea of time to completion and lowers uncertainty.

## Fixed

A fixed progress bar has a certain amount of steps and those steps are done in a set order. A fixed bar is used for smaller amounts of steps where the process won't be completed in one sitting.

<Playground>
  <FixedProgress
    steps={{
      "Step One": true,
      "Step Two": false,
      "Step Three": false
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Fluid

A fluid progress bar can have an almost unlimited amount of steps. It is usually used when the process contains a lot of smaller pieces and can be accomplished in one sitting.

<Playground>
  <FluidProgress label="Here is the correct thing" current={2} total={6} />
</Playground>
