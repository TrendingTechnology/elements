# Grids

Grids are used to build consistent, responsive layouts. They use css-grid under the hood and are absracted to give you as little headache as possible. They've been redesigned from v1 to work with an array prop syntaxt.

<Playground column>
  <Grid style={{ height: "20rem" }}>
    <Col style={{ background: colors.green_500 }} span={[12]} />
    <Col style={{ background: colors.green_500 }} span={[4]} />
    <Col style={{ background: colors.green_500 }} span={[4]} />
    <Col style={{ background: colors.green_500 }} span={[4]} />
  </Grid>
</Playground>
