# Grids

Grids are used to build consistent, responsive layouts. They use css-grid under the hood and are absracted to give you as little headache as possible. They've been redesigned from v1 to work with an array prop syntaxt.

<Playground column>
  {() => {
    const styles = { background: colors.green_500 }
    return (
      <Grid style={{ height: "20rem" }}>
        <Col style={styles} span={[12, 6]} />
        <Col style={styles} span={[4, 6]} />
        <Col style={styles} span={[4, 6]} />
        <Col style={styles} span={[4, 6]} />
      </Grid>
    )
  }}
</Playground>
