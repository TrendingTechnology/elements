# Container

Containers are used to prevent the layout from becoming unusable on large scale screens. They have a default max-width of `960px` or `80rem`.

<Playground>
  {/* Use the fullscreen mode to see the container in action. */}
  <Container>
    <div style={{ height: "20rem", background: "pink" }} />
  </Container>
</Playground>
